# Take Home Assessement -- Hummingbird TSE #  

### Technical Assessement ### 

Challenges 1 & 2 involve JavaScript files which can be run using the following commands, with the results logging to the terminal. Running the scripts requires NodeJS & Node Package Manger (npm).
- [NodeJS Install instructions](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [NPM install instruction](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

After navigating to the correct directory
```bash
    # installs project dependecies
    npm install

    # run challenge 1
    npm run challenge-1

    # run challenge 2
    npm run challenge-2
```

### Written Assessement ###

My written response to Challenges 2 & 3 can be found in the `challenge-2.md` & `challenge-3.md` files respectively.
